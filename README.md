# Note on VR Video Viewer
1. The VR Video Viewer works on Unity 5.2.2p.
2. For the [plugin](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/59897) to work in the editor, Unity needs to be forced into directX 9 mode. However, when the project gets compiled, it does not matter.
3. For Oculus SDK to work, the Unity project needs to be compiled. This is because we are using an old model (DK2), which doesn't work with the latest Unity.
